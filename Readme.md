# Deploying ML Models with Docker

## Introduction
Tired of fixing the same deployment issues? Learn how Docker can keep your ML models running smoothly, every time. 🚀

## 🤔 Steps to Deploy... 🪜

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - ➡️ Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.

2. **Build Your Machine Learning Model**
   - ➡️ Have a trained model ready for deployment.

3. **Create a `requirements.txt` File**
   - ➡️ List all dependencies needed for your model.

4. **Create a Dockerfile**
   - ➡️ Define the environment and steps to build the Docker image.

5. **Build a Docker Image**
   - ➡️ **Build a Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t ml-model .

Run the Docker Container
➡️ docker run ml-model

Output:--> 
Model trained and saved as model.pkl
Prediction for [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]: 0

## Tag & Push the Container to DockerHub

➡️ Create a Docker Hub account and log in through the terminal:
```bash
docker login


 ➡️Tag the image:
'''bash
 docker tag ml-model yourdockerhubusername/ml-model


➡️Push the image:
```bash
docker push yourdockerhubusername/ml-model


➡️Pull and Run the Docker Image
```bash
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/ml-model

 ➡️Run the image:
```bash
docker run yourdockerhubusername/ml-model


Conclusion
Using Docker for deploying machine learning models guarantees a consistent environment and set of dependencies across various platforms,
making the deployment process smoother and more scalable. With Docker, model deployment is more straightforward, 
and the need for complex environment setup is eliminated. 🚀
